# Research: Docusaurus for Physical AI Book

## Decision: Use Docusaurus 2.x

**Rationale**: Docusaurus is a modern static site generator that is perfect for building documentation websites. It is easy to use, has great features like versioning and search, and is highly extensible. Version 2.x is the current stable release and has excellent community support.

**Alternatives considered**:
*   **GitBook**: A popular platform for building online books, but it is a commercial product with limitations on the free tier.
*   **Jekyll**: A flexible static site generator, but requires more configuration and setup than Docusaurus.

## Best Practices for Docusaurus Setup

*   **Project Structure**: Use the classic Docusaurus preset which provides a good starting point for a documentation website.
*   **Content**: Organize content into chapters and lessons using directories and markdown files.
*   **Navigation**: Use the Docusaurus sidebar configuration to define the navigation structure of the book.
*   **Styling**: Customize the look and feel of the site using the `custom.css` file.
